# Lab computers

The lab has three computers. All share the same login/password. Don't know the password? Ask your EEG Guru.

## #1 STIM (left monitor)

Use for stimuli administration and other stuff. This is the one you run PsychoPy on.


## #2 RECORDER (right monitor)

Used **only** for recording EEG with ActiView.
