# Git basics

Git is a [version control system](https://git-scm.com) that we use for many, mostly software-related projects here. This book is also controlled by Git. Git is [a bit hard and not intuitive](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) at first, but makes total sense once you get a handle of it. If you want to contribute to anything at ANLab, you need to learn Git.

We use [GitHub](https://github.com), a Microsoft-owned online platform to store Git repositories.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a Github account
2. Identify with your name/nickname/face so that we know who you are (and can accept your pull requests)
3. Make friends with the Terminal and VS Code

## Repositories

Github repositories (_repos_) are places where projects are stored under [version control](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/). Project consists of any number of files and folders. Version control is incredibly useful because it allows for:
- keeping the (almost) entire history of changes to the project
- smooth collaboration with safety features (stupid moves are easily revertible and don't break the project)
- [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) practices (anyone can contribute!)
