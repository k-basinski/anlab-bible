# Zotero

It's great to use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) for keeping track of your papers because: 
- It's a nice PDF reader and keeps everything tidy. 
- It has great features for collaboration (share papers through groups). 
- Most importantly, it has plugins to do automatic bibliography for MS Word and Google Docs! 
- If you really want to use LaTeX, it can provide you with *.bib files.
- Zotero is open source and developed by an independent, nonprofit organization that has no financial interest in your private information. Unlike EndNote, Mendeley etc.
